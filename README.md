# react-pomodoro

## Description

This solo project is a part of the Becode Web Developer Training that lasted from May till November 2020.

The goal of the exercise was to discover [React](https://reactjs.org/). We were asked to create a simple pomodoro timer. 

We also had to use [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) and follow some code quality rules, with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/).

## Instructions

The pomodoro had to contain :
* a timer
* 4 buttons 
    * a toggle for start and pause
    * a reset button 
    * one button to add time and another to remove time (those two had to be disabled while the timer was running)
* a modal window that would contain
    * a button to restart a timer
    * a button to close the modal
* the app had to be deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

It was adviced to prefer the use of React hooks rather than React classes.

## Time Limit

The project was given september 10th 2020 and the deadline was september 17th 2020 at 9am.
